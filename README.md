This application applies various tests to check the level of randomness of the contents of a file (sequence of bytes)
It also allows you to view the "fingerprint" of the file, a sort of hash value in the form of a square image, where any patterns that could escape a statistical analysis emerge and helps establish the probability that the sequence is random or not.
